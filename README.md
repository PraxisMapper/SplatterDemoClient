This is a quick way to start up making your own PraxisMapper games with Solar2D. The app is very lightweight and shows how to interact with the server and how to handle user interactions with the client. On the login screen, you will want to update the server URL box to point at the server you're hosting. Localhost:5000 is the assumption that you're in the simulator, and won't work on your actual phone.
